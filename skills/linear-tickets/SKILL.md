# Linear Ticket Creation Skill

## When This Skill Activates

This skill automatically activates when you:
- Create a Linear issue or ticket
- Are asked to plan work, break down a feature, or file a bug
- Use `/ticket` or are asked to "create an issue"
- Break a large task into sub-tickets

## Core Principle

**A ticket is a contract.** The person implementing it (human or AI) should be able to understand the full context — who's affected, what the user experiences, what the architecture looks like, and when it's done — without asking follow-up questions.

## Ticket Description Template

Every ticket description MUST use this structure, adapting sections based on complexity:

````markdown
## Complexity Assessment

**Estimated Effort:** [Quick Win (0-2 days) | Standard (3-5 days) | Complex (6+ days)]

**Reasoning:** [Why this complexity tier? Consider: # of files affected, schema changes needed, external integrations, architectural decisions]

**If Complex (6+ days):** This ticket should be broken down into 2-3 smaller, independently shippable tickets. See breakdown pattern below.

**Suggested Breakdown (if complex):**
1. **Milestone 1 (Enabler):** [Foundation work — schema, API endpoints] [X days]
2. **Milestone 2 (Feature):** [User-facing feature — UI, workflows] [Y days]
3. **Milestone 3 (Feature):** [Additional functionality — bulk actions, filters] [Z days]

Each milestone should ship value independently.

## User Story

As a **[persona]**, I want to **[action]** so that **[outcome]**.

> Example: As a **sales manager**, I want to **see which reps haven't logged calls this week** so that **I can follow up before pipeline reviews**.

## Context

<2-3 sentences: Why does this matter now? What triggered this work? Link to related tickets, customer feedback, or incidents.>

## Current Behavior

<What happens today? For bugs: exact repro steps. For features: what the user currently does (often a workaround).>

## Expected Behavior

<What should happen after this ticket is done? Be specific — "it should work" is not acceptable.>

## User Journey

<Step-by-step flow showing how the user interacts with this change.>

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User
    participant App as Application
    participant API as Backend
    U->>App: [Action the user takes]
    App->>API: [What the app does]
    API-->>App: [Response]
    App-->>U: [What the user sees]
```

## Architecture

<Which layers/components are involved? Include a diagram for any multi-component change.>

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Component] --> B[Server Action]
    B --> C[Repository]
    C --> D[Database]
```

**Key files:**
| File | Role |
|------|------|
| `path/to/file.ts` | Description of what this file does |

## Edge Cases

- [ ] <Boundary condition 1 — e.g., "What if the user has no data?">
- [ ] <Boundary condition 2 — e.g., "What if the org has 100+ items?">
- [ ] <Error state — e.g., "What if the external API is down?">
- [ ] <Concurrency — e.g., "What if two users edit simultaneously?">

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] <Concrete, testable criterion 1>
- [ ] <Concrete, testable criterion 2>
- [ ] <Concrete, testable criterion 3>
- [ ] Unit tests cover core logic
- [ ] CI pipeline passes

## Testing Plan

### Automated
- Unit tests for: <list specific functions/actions>
- Integration tests for: <if applicable>

### Manual
- [ ] <Step-by-step manual test 1>
- [ ] <Step-by-step manual test 2>

## Dependencies

- Blocked by: <ISSUE-XXX if applicable>
- Blocks: <ISSUE-XXX if applicable>
- External: <Any external service dependency>

## Section Usage by Ticket Type

Not every ticket needs every section. Use this guide:

| Section | Feature | Bug | Improvement | Chore |
|---------|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Complexity Assessment | **Required** | **Required** | **Required** | **Required** |
| User Story | **Required** | **Required** | **Required** | Optional |
| Context | **Required** | **Required** | **Required** | Brief |
| Current Behavior | **Required** | **Required** (repro steps) | **Required** | Skip |
| Expected Behavior | **Required** | **Required** | **Required** | Skip |
| User Journey | **Required** | If UI-related | If UI-related | Skip |
| Architecture | If multi-component | If non-obvious | If refactor | Skip |
| Edge Cases | **Required** | **Required** | **Required** | Skip |
| Acceptance Criteria | **Required** | **Required** | **Required** | **Required** |
| Testing Plan | **Required** | **Required** | **Required** | Optional |
| Dependencies | If applicable | If applicable | If applicable | If applicable |

## Creating the Issue

### Step 1: Research the Codebase

Before writing the ticket, understand what exists:

```bash
# Find relevant files
# Read existing implementations
# Understand current architecture
```

This context goes directly into the Architecture section and Key Files table.

### Step 2: Write the Description

Follow the template above. Key quality checks:
- **Complexity Assessment** is present with estimated effort tier and reasoning
- **If 6+ days:** Breakdown is suggested with independently shippable milestones
- **User Story** names a real persona (not "a user")
- **Edge Cases** has at least 3 items for features, 2 for bugs
- **Acceptance Criteria** are testable — each one could be a unit test assertion
- **Architecture** includes file paths, not vague component names

### Step 3: Create in Linear

Use the Linear MCP tools to create the issue:
- **Title:** Use conventional commit style (see format below)
- **Description:** Full markdown from template
- **Labels:** Apply appropriate type label
- **Priority:** Use the priority guide below

### Step 4: Set Relationships

If the ticket blocks or is blocked by other work, set the relationships using Linear's blocking/blocked-by fields.

## Title Format

Use conventional commit style for consistency with PRs and commits:

```
feat(scheduler): add buffer time configuration
fix(billing): prevent duplicate charge on plan switch
refactor(webhooks): extract handler registry
perf(dashboard): lazy-load analytics charts
chore(deps): upgrade SDK to latest version
```

Keep titles under 70 characters. Use the description for details.

## Labels

Always apply exactly one primary label:
- **Feature** — new functionality
- **Bug** — broken existing functionality
- **Improvement** — enhancement to existing functionality

## Priority Guide

| Priority | When to Use |
|----------|-------------|
| 1 - Urgent | Production is broken, revenue impact |
| 2 - High | Blocks other work, customer-facing regression |
| 3 - Normal | Standard feature/improvement work |
| 4 - Low | Nice-to-have, tech debt, minor polish |

## Breaking Down Large Tickets

If a ticket is too large (estimated >2 days), break it into sub-tickets:

1. Create a parent ticket with the full vision (all sections)
2. Create child tickets, each independently shippable
3. Each child references the parent: "Part of ISSUE-XXX"
4. Each child has its own acceptance criteria

```
ISSUE-100: feat(analytics): revenue dashboard (parent -- full context)
  |-- ISSUE-101: feat(analytics): revenue summary cards
  |-- ISSUE-102: feat(analytics): revenue trend chart
  |-- ISSUE-103: feat(analytics): revenue by rep breakdown
```

## Anti-Patterns

```markdown
# Missing complexity assessment -- no scope clarity
Title: "Add analytics dashboard"
Description: Full user story, edge cases, acceptance criteria
(No mention of: estimated effort, whether it needs breakdown, which tier)

# Mixing enabler and feature work in one ticket
Title: "Add revenue analytics"
Description: "Create table + build dashboard UI + send daily emails"
(Should be 3 tickets: schema migration, UI feature, email feature)

# Tickets that should be 3 smaller tickets
Title: "Improve onboarding flow"  (6+ days estimated but not broken down)
(Should be: status badge [1d], reconnection flow [2d], progress indicator [1d])

# Thin ticket -- no context for implementer
Title: "Fix the dashboard"
Description: "Dashboard is broken, please fix"

# Missing edge cases -- bugs will ship
Title: "Add CSV export"
Description: "Users should be able to export data as CSV"
(No mention of: empty data, large datasets, special characters, encoding)

# Vague acceptance criteria -- how do you know when it's done?
Acceptance: "It should work correctly"

# Missing architecture -- implementer has to rediscover everything
Title: "Add booking notifications"
Description: "Send a notification when a booking is created"
(No mention of: which service, what template, what data, error handling)
```

## Bidirectional Linking: Ticket to PR

When a ticket is created:
- The branch name should contain the issue ID: `feat/ISSUE-XXX-description`
- The PR description includes a section linking back to the issue: `Fixes: ISSUE-XXX`
- On merge, the issue tracker can auto-close the issue

This creates full traceability: Ticket -> Branch -> PR -> Merge -> Auto-close.
